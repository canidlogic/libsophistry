# libsophistry
This library defines a common image scanline and a common audio buffer format.  This library is meant for use by image, video, and audio codecs, so that the codecs can each share the same buffer objects to transfer image and audio data to and from multimedia data files.  libsophistry does not define any codecs on its own, focusing purely on the definition of objects used to get multimedia data in and out of multimedia files.

The image scanline defined by libsophistry supports a width in pixels from one up to and including 32,767.  Each pixel is a 32-bit unsigned integer that encodes 8-bit alpha, red, green, and blue channels in ARGB order from most significant byte to least significant byte.  The alpha channel is zero for fully transparent, 255 for fully opaque, and linear in between.  The RGB channels vary from zero for no intensity to 255 for full intensity.  The nonlinear encoding (gamma correction) of the RGB channels is equivalent to the sRGB standard.  The RGB primaries definitions and D65 whitepoint are equivalent to both the sRGB standard and the ITU-R BT.709-6 ("Rec. 709") standard.  The alpha channel is non-premultiplied with respect to the RGB channels.

The audio buffer defined by libsophistry supports from one up to and including 4,194,303 sample frames.  Each sample frame consists of exactly two channels, the first of which is the left channel and the second of which is the right channel.  Each channel sample is a signed 16-bit value in range -32,768 up to and including 32,767.  Channel samples encoded as Linear Pulse Code Modulation (Linear PCM, or LPCM).  The buffer is represented as a sequence of signed 16-bit integers representing the channel samples, with integers paired in left and right channels as described above.

libsophistry also supports auxiliary functions to aid in converting from the image scanline and audio buffer formats used by Sophistry into other common formats.  This is intended for codecs that have image or audio data in a different format.
